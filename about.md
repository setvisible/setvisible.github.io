ArrowDL is a **Free & Open-Source** software that helps you to download all links,
pictures, videos from Youtube 
and other video sites, — Peer-to-peer — BitTorrent files,
and other media you find on the Web.

- It’s called a **“mass” download manager**,
because it helps you to select, organize, prioritize and run your downloads in parallel
