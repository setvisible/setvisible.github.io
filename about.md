## How it works?

The browser add-on (this extension) sends the links to the open-source standalone application ArrowDL.

Why a standalone application?
This download manager is a standalone application,
in order to separate this extension’s life cycle from the browser’s life cycle.
Moreover a standalone manager provides a lot more features,
not limited to the web browser or WebExtensions' API,
so we could implement all the features we imagine.
