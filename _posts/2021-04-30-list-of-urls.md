Note that:
- the text editor is tolerant to extra spaces and extra lines (**ArrowDL** will not download empty lines!)
- There's the "*Block*" edition mode, which allows to change several lines in a row.
- Obviously there are the *copy, paste, cut, undo, redo* things.

Last but not the least, do not hesitate to compliment the icon ![Icon](/assets/images/2.3/paste_48x48.png) (I did it myself with [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/)...).
