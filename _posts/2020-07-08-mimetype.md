When you click a **magnet link**, or download a **.torrent file**, you might want to open them with ArrowDL.

To do so, setup the association of these types of file with ArrowDL:

**Windows, Linux, MacOs** offer options to associate the file extension ".torrent" to ArrowDL, so that ArrowDL opens .torrent files.

**Mozilla Firefox** defines the default application to start or open a certain file extension or MIME type. Read instructions here: [Change what Firefox does when you click on or download a file](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-firefox-behavior-when-open-file).

__Remark:__

Always associate the extensions/MIME types to `arrowdl` (windows: `arrowdl.exe`)... not to the `launcher`!
