## Name Change Announcement

As part of the continued development of the project, we are excited to announce the project will change its name to **ArrowDL**.

> **ArrowDL** stands for *Arrow Downloader*.

We have changed the name to reflect our ambition for expansion. This is an exciting time for our team and our users. The name change represents an opportunity to do more for our users, offering a simple and user-friendly download tool, and of course gain a better visibility. The new name takes effect on January 1 of the coming new year.

This is a step forward for our project. We understand you might have questions, but you can expect our top-quality service to continue. The name change does mean that our capabilities have expanded, including a comprehensive re-branding of the user experience, with a brand new GUI, a more modern look-n-feel.

A deep refactoring of the **ArrowDL** website is coming soon.

> The project will be hosted on:

We will be following up with you to answer any questions you might have. If you'd like to reach out before then, please don't hesitate to reach out to us on the issues page of the discussion forum.

See you soon :)
