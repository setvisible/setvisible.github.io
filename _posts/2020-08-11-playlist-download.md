**ArrowDL** can now **download playlists** from Youtube and other video stream sites.

To do so, use the same Wizard as usual:

- Click **File** > **Download Streams...**

The wizard will detect if the URL refers to a single video stream or a playlist.

## Playlist streams

The application shows the playlist and download options for each item, so that you can select which streams you want to download:

Click **Start!** when ready.


## Downloading the playlist

The result:

Note: this is a preliminary wizard window. It might change in the near future.
