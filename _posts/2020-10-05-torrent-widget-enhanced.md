introduction: An Enhancement of the Torrent Widget
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

The **torrent widget** (which appears when you download a *.torrent* file or *magnet link*) has been improved.

Tables are now **sortable**. If you click on the table header, it sorts the items by the column.

From now on, the torrent widget shows a **piece-by-piece** progress bar for the global torrent file in the *Info* tab. The same kind of bars present the **peer's available pieces** under the *Peers* tab.

The *Peer* tab also displays the **peer flags** as emojis:). If you let the mouse above, a tool tip presents more details.

The tab keeps the former connections in *italic*, you can filter them through the mouse's context menu.

The *Piece Map* tab now shows the **piece map** of the torrent.
