## Windows installer translations

The installer for Windows is now translated in:
- English
- Arabic
- SimpChinese
- French
- German
- Korean
- Italian
- Portuguese
- PortugueseBR
- Russian
- Spanish

Note: The NSIS project provides already translated dialogs, so it's nice to re-use this work. However a dozen of messages are specific to ArrowDL... so in a context of releasing quickly these changes, I did quick-n-dirty Google Translate for these sentences.

If you think they are poor, don't hesitate to contribute.
