## Introducing Magnet Links and Torrents download

*ArrowDL* version 2.0.0 is now able to download .torrent files.

### Why a torrent manager?

After implementing a web page content crawler, then a kind of RegExp downloader for batch file downloading, and recently a video streaming downloader, why not adding a new feature in order to download peer-to-peer things like torrents?

So there is.

Indeed, good torrent downloaders have a problem: they are mostly shareware / closed-source software. History is full of solution providers that use their torrent application to **mine bitcoins** without **user consent**, polluting the UI with **advertising banners**, or simply collect the users data to resell it to marketing agencies, crackers and maybe policing government institutions.

In the FOS (free and open-source) world, there are not tons of choices. So ArrowDL is a new way to **enjoy torrents again**. The technology behind the peer-to-peer concept is very exciting to explore, and open so many opportunities.


### How it 's made

*ArrowDL* uses the library *libtorrent*, a free and open-source library by Arvid Norberg to download magnet links and .torrent files.
